Need to add downstream processing to figure and 'Days' above numbers 

\textbf{Figure S1.} A schematic of the experimental design.  A complex carbon mixture, in addition to inorganic salts and amino acids not shown here, was added to soil microcosms (with mg in parentheses of each substrate added). A days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 replicate microcosms were destructively harvested for downstream molecular applications.
