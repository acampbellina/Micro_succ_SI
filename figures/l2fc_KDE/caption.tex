\textbf{Figure Sx.} Kernel density estimation of all OTUs within each phylum along the log2foldchange scale. The rug demonstrates responses types: nonresponder (black), cellulose responder (blue), and xylose responder (green). This highlights the density of the 'responders' within an phylum in the context of all OTUs detected within that phylum, as well as, the maginitude of the response.
