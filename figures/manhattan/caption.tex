\textbf{Figure Sx.} A manhattan plot summarizing 'responders' for \textsuperscript{13}C-cellulose (top) and \textsuperscript{13}C-xylose (below).  Each dot represents a single OTU, colored by phylum. P values are calculated from DESeq analysis and adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR). 'Responders' are OTUs with adjusted P values less than an FDR of 0.10 and correspond to dots that are greater than zero on the manhattan plot.
