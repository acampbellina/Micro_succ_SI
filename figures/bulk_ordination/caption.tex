\textbf{Figure S2.} NMDS analysis from weighted unifrac distances of 454 sequence data. Left: SIP fractions (grey, described in Figure 1) and bulk community (colored) of each treatment (control, circle; cellulose, triangle; xylose, square) over time. Right: Bulk community sequencing colored by day.  Demonstrates community composition changes with time (color), with little variation in composition between different treatments (shapes) within a time point.
