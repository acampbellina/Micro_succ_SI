Density profiles of all xylose responders over time. Each panel is the relative abundance throughout the density gradient for a responder within a day for the control (orange) and \textsuperscript{13}C-xylose treatment (green). Panels on the right side are the relative abundance of each responder in the bulk community sequencing over time.
